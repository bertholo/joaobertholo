        <h3 style="text-align: center;">Introduction</h3>

        <p>
            Budget Buddy is a full-stack application that I am currently working on. It is originally an
            expense tracker with a transactions history section and some graphs displaying the balance, current month
            espenditure and history chart. New features will be added in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
            Built using <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Bootstrap</strong> and <strong>Chart.js</strong> as Front End
            technologies, as well as
            <strong>Node.js</strong> with the <strong>Express.js</strong> library and <strong>MongoDB</strong> as the
            database.
        </p>
        <img src="img/budget-buddy-body-1.png" alt="budget-buddy" />
        <p>
            On the Front End, the App manages State globally with <strong>useContext</strong> that handles the
            <strong>API requests</strong>
            for incomes and expenses via the <strong>useState</strong> hook and the errors as well. On the App.js file,
            State is managed by
            a function that uses a switch statement to determine which Component to display. The Default is set to be
            the Dashboard Component.
        </p>
        <p>
            The fun side of this project was to be working with charts via <strong>Chart.js</strong>. It is so many
            types of charts, datasets and
            options that you can spend some time playing with all the different layouts. Even though it was fun to work
            with, it was challenging
            trying to connect the data from the input of incomes or expenses and the dates with the datasets from the
            charts.
        </p>

        <p>
            The charts counts with moment.js to set the date format and some helper functions to get the months from
            transactions, amounts, sort the months
            in order and group the amounts toguether depending on the chart. If there is no input for a certain month,
            its amount is set to zero.
        </p>

        <p>
            Incomes and Expenses pages are very similar in layout and functionality. Both of them have an unique icon
            for each income or expense,
            there is an input form that adds a new item to the database with the app updating immediately, as well as a
            delete button that deletes the item
            from the database with the instant update of the App and finally the total income or expense displayed at
            the top.
        </p>

        <p>
            On the Back End side, I use <strong>morgan</strong> for HTTP request logging and <strong>cors</strong> to
            manage cross-origin resource sharing.
            The Application use the standard <strong>RESTful API</strong> to improve scalability and flexibility.
        </p>
        <p>
            The database has two models: Income and Expense. Each model has a title, amount, type, date, description,
            and category. Validation acordingly.
            The Schemas were created with <strong>mongoose</strong>.
        </p>
